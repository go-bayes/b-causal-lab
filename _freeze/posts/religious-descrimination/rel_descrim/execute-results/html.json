That is, leverage time-series data to identify causality.\n\nThird, we briefly speculate about the relevance of these findings to different audiences.\n\n## Method\n\n## Results\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n|Â                  |Time8             |Time9             |Time10            |Time11            |Time12            |Time13            |\n|:-----------------|:-----------------|:-----------------|:-----------------|:-----------------|:-----------------|:-----------------|\n|                  |(N=21936)         |(N=21867)         |(N=21796)         |(N=21717)         |(N=21661)         |(N=21936)         |\n|Mean (SD)         |2.04 (1.42)       |2.07 (1.43)       |1.96 (1.36)       |1.93 (1.37)       |1.89 (1.35)       |1.86 (1.33)       |\n|Median [Min, Max] |1.00 [1.00, 7.00] |1.00 [1.00, 7.00] |1.00 [1.00, 7.00] |1.00 [1.00, 7.00] |1.00 [1.00, 7.00] |1.00 [1.00, 7.00] |\n|Missing           |780 (3.6%)        |6742 (30.8%)      |6089 (27.9%)      |7995 (36.8%)      |8099 (37.4%)      |10060 (45.9%)     |\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {#fig-rel-16 .cell layout-ncol=\"2\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Change in Religious Identification](rel_descrim_files/figure-html/fig-rel-16-1.png){#fig-rel-16-1 width=672}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Change in Spiritual Identification](rel_descrim_files/figure-html/fig-rel-16-2.png){#fig-rel-16-2 width=672}\n:::\n\nReligious and Spiritual Change in Time 2016 Cohort.\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Perceived Religious/Spiritual Discrimination in the Time 2016 NZAVS Cohort.](rel_descrim_files/figure-html/fig-dis-16-1.png){#fig-dis-16 width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {#fig-rel-to-dis .cell .column-page layout-ncol=\"2\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![3 year causal effect of Religious Identification on Religious/Spiritual Discrimination](rel_descrim_files/figure-html/fig-rel-to-dis-1.png){#fig-rel-to-dis-1 width=672}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![5 year causal effect of Religious Identification on Religious/Spiritual Discrimination](rel_descrim_files/figure-html/fig-rel-to-dis-2.png){#fig-rel-to-dis-2 width=672}\n:::\n\nReligious Identification Effects on Religious/Spiritual Discrimination.\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {#fig-spi-to-dis .cell .column-page layout-ncol=\"2\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![3 year causal effect of Spiritual Identification on Religious/Spiritual Discrimination](rel_descrim_files/figure-html/fig-spi-to-dis-1.png){#fig-spi-to-dis-1 width=672}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![5 year causal effect of Spiritual Identification on Religious/Spiritual Discrimination](rel_descrim_files/figure-html/fig-spi-to-dis-2.png){#fig-spi-to-dis-2 width=672}\n:::\n\nSpirituality Effects on Religious/Spiritual Discrimination.\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {#fig-dis-to-rs .cell .column-page layout-ncol=\"2\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![4 year causal effect of Religious/Spiritual Discrimination on Religious Identification](rel_descrim_files/figure-html/fig-dis-to-rs-1.png){#fig-dis-to-rs-1 width=672}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![4 year causal effect of Religious/Spiritual Discrimination on Spiritual Identification](rel_descrim_files/figure-html/fig-dis-to-rs-2.png){#fig-dis-to-rs-2 width=672}\n:::\n\nReligious/Spiritual Discrimination effects on Religious/Spiritual Identification.\n:::\n\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nNotes: - do experiences of prejudice among people of the faith foster greater acceptance of religious minorities [@shaver2016]?\n\nThe topic is under-researched. religious decline is slow. Although religious people are a minority in New Zealand, for most of New Zealand's colonial history there has been a religious majority. Because the decline in religious identification is less than 1% annually, the proportion of religious proportion year-to-year is not substantially different [@hoverd2015]. Like the receding of a glacier, the decline of the religious minority is not readily apparent to the naked eye. Although these facts may help to explain the poverty of research on anti-religious prejudice, they do not provide excuses for ignoring it.\n\n## Importance\n\nThere are three audiences who might be interested in the longitudinal study of anti-religious prejudice.\n\nFirst, there are social scientists. There has been considerable scientific attention to study of prejudice against historically marginalised groups. However, in countries such as New Zealand, religious people have only recently become the minority. Moreover, the bulk of prejudice research occurs in North America where the religiously identified remain a majority.\n\nSecond, there are philosophers and theologians. If we assume that good philosophy and theology must be grounded in the facts, it would seem important to include a growing religious minority in philosophical and theological reflection about prejudice.\n\nThird, there are members of religious communities, including clergy. If the study of anti-religious prejudice reveals that many religious people are indeed experiencing greater prejudice religious communities should want to know.\n",
