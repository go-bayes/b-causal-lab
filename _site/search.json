    "text": "Importance\nThere are three reasons that it is important to study anti-religious prejudice.\nFirst, despite considerable attention across the humanities and social sciences to historically marginalised groups, the systematic study of prejudice among groups with proportionally decreasing numbers remains poorly researched.\nIt is perhaps understandable that anti-religious prejudice is under-researched. Religious decline is slow. In New Zealand, there has been less than 1% annual loss among those who identify as religious [citations]. In any given year, the religious proportion resembles that of the previous year. Like the receding of a glacier, the decline of a religious minority is not apparent to the naked eye. Moreover, there is evidence that religious decline is occurring mostly among younger cohorts. Because outside of work people tend to interact within cohorts, religious decline might be less evident in middle aged and older cohorts. Finally, the bulk of social scientific on religion occurs in North America, where the religiously identified remain a majority, and where anti-atheist prejudice remains dominant. Indeed, the religious segment in New Zealand only became a minority relatively recently in 2xxx. Although these facts may help to explain the poverty of research on anti-religious prejudice, they do not provide excuses. We hope to offer some clarification about the gap in social-scientific understanding.\nSecond, it is important study anti-religious prejudice because good ethics begins with good facts. Philosophers and Theologians are prone to disagree. However, nearly all agree that one can be held to the same standards to which one holds others. If ethicists are interested in reasoning about prejudice against marginal groups, it would seem important to consider whether the growing religious minority is increasingly targetted for prejudice.\nThird, it is important to"
