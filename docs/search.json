    "text": "Confounding occurs when the statistical association between indicators in the data do not reflect a causal association between parameters in a target population. A causal graph is a qualitative tool that enables us to quickly inspect sources of confounding.\nWe may represent our strategy for confounding control using the causal graph presented in Figure 1.\nWe define an exposure or treatment by $A$. We define \\boldsymbol{Y} as the set of all well-being outcomes contained in the NZAVS. Our interest is in consistently estimating the causal effect of congregation size on each of these outcomes. To consistently estimate the causal effect of an exposure A=1 on the vector of well-being outcomes \\boldsymbol{Y} we must ensure that we have included a set of confounders that will prevent any statistical association between A and Y in the absence of causation. A statistical association in the absence of a causal association may arise in one of three ways.: (1) A and Y share a common cause. (2) A and Y share a common effect. (3) There is confounding by descent, such that conditioning on a confounder introduces a statistical association between A and Y in the absence of a casual association (collider bias).\nTo address challenge (1) we may condition or stratify on all measured common causes of A and Y. To address challenges (2) and (3), we must not condition on any effect or desendent of an effect. Note however that by conditioning on a descent of a common cause we may at least partially address conditioning by a common cause. This is because conditioning on the effect of a common cause may itself partially block the effect of the that common cause.\nHere, we use a modified version of VanderWeele et al’s approach to estimate causal effects using three waves of NZAVS panel data (VanderWeele, Mathur, and Chen 2020).\nCall t-1 the baseline wave, t_0 the exposure wave, and t+1 the outcome measurement wave. First, we include at baseline indicators of all past outcomes \\boldsymbol{Y}_{t-1}. Second, we include at baseline an indicator for the past exposure A_{t-1}. Third, we include a rich set of baseline confounders \\boldsymbol{L_{t-1}}. Of course, we cannot ensure that this strategy is sufficient to ensure no unmeasured confounding. However, on On VanderWeele’s strategy, for any unmeasured confounder to affect both the exposure/outcome association, it would need to do so independently of its effects on prior measurements of the exposure and (all) outcomes at baseline, in addition to all measured baseline confounders. Note also that by controlling for measured confounders the wave prior to exposure we avoid unwittingly conditioning on an effects of the exposure that subsequently affects the outcome – mediator bias. Note furthermore that by measuring the outcome in the year following the exposure, Y_{t+1}, we ensure that the exposure temporally precedes the outcome, and is not, for example, an effect of the outcome. Finally, loss-to-follow-up or attrition, as well as survey non-response may introduce selection bias (represented by the boxed S_{t+1}). There are several ways in which uch selection bias may introduce confounding. In Figure 1, we note the prospect in which a novel common cause of A and Y called U_s may lead to a spurious association between A and Y if S is a collider of A and U_s. To avoid selection bias we multiply impute the missing responses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nVanderWeele, Tyler J, Maya B Mathur, and Ying Chen. 2020. “Outcome-Wide Longitudinal Designs for Causal Inference: A New Template for Empirical Studies.” Statistical Science 35 (3): 437466.\n\nReuseCC BY-NC-SACitationBibTeX citation:@online{bulbulia2022,\n  author = {Joseph Bulbulia},\n  title = {Outcome-Wide {Causal} {Inference} in the {NZAVS}},\n  date = {2022-11-02},\n  url = {https://go-bayes.github.io/b-causal-lab/},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nJoseph Bulbulia. 2022. “Outcome-Wide Causal Inference in the\nNZAVS.” November 2, 2022. https://go-bayes.github.io/b-causal-lab/."

    "text": "Causal inference\nSuppose we want to learn whether a dichotomous exposure has a causal effect. We must answer three questions:\n\nWhat would happen with exposure?\nWhat would happen with no exposure?\nDo these potential outcomes differ?\n\nConsider a binary exposure A with two levels, A = 0 and A=1 and a continuous outcome Y.  Estimating the causal effect of A on outcome Y requires contrasting two states of the world.  The state of the the world Y^1 when, perhaps contrary to fact, A is set to 1 and the state of the world Y^0 when, perhaps contrary to fact, A is set to 0. We say that A affects Y  when the quantitiesY^{a=1} - Y^{a=0} \\neq 0.  \n\nThe fundamental problem of causal inference.\nNote that, at any given time, at most only one level of the exposure A may be realised for any individual. That is, Y^{a=1} and Y^{a=0} are never simultaneously observed in any individual.  As such, individual-level causal effects are not typically identifiable from data. This is called the funamental problem of causal inference (Rubin 1976; Gelman, Hill, and Vehtari 2020). It is for this reason that we refer to the Y^{a=1} and Y^{a=0} – the quantities of interest – as “potential” or “counterfactual” outcomes.\nAlthough we cannot generally obtain counterfactual contrasts for individuals, when certain assumptions are satisfied, we may identify the average or marginal causal effects at the level of groups of individuals who are experience different levels of exposure.  We say there is an average or marginal causal effect if the difference of the averages of the population who are exposed and unexposed does not equal zero:  E(Y^{a=1}) - E(Y^{a=0})\\neq 0 . Likewise, because the difference of the means is equivalent to the mean of the differences, if E(Y^{a=1} - Y^{a=0})\\neq 0 (Hernan and Robins 2023).  This contrast in the expected average of the counterfactual outcomes is the marginal effect. Here, our example uses a binary exposure but we may contrast the counterfactual outcomes for two levels of a continuous exposure. To do this we must state the levels of exposure at which we seek comparisons. \nCritically, to ensure valid inference, we need to ensure that the potential outcomes are independent of the exposures received, namely: \nY^a  \\perp\\!\\!\\!\\perp A|L\nOr equivalently:\nA \\perp\\!\\!\\!\\perp Y^a |L\nIf we have have only observational data, we cannot generally ensure that the exposures are independent of the counterfactual outcomes. For this reason, we use sensitivity analyis such at the calculating an E-value to assess the robustness of any result to unmeasured confounding (VanderWeele and Ding 2017)."

To avoid implausible assumptions of linearity we model the relationship between the exposure each of the potential outcomes of interest using a cubic spline.  We include in the set of baseline confounders \\boldsymbol{L} the baseline measure of the exposure as well as the baseline response (or responses):\n\n\\{A\\_{t-1}, \\boldsymbol{Y_{t-1}} = (Y_{1, t-1}, Y_{2, t-1}, Y_{3, t-1}\\dots Y_{n, t-1})\\} \\subset \\boldsymbol{L}  \nThis gives us\nE(Y|A, \\boldsymbol{L})\n\nSecond, we use the model in (1) to predict the values of a potential outcome Y^{a} by setting the exposure to the value A = a.\n\nThis gives us\n\\hat{E}(Y|A = a, \\boldsymbol{L})\n\nThird, we use the model in (1) to predict the values of a different potential outcome Y^{a*}by setting the exposure to a different value of A =a^{\\star}.\n\nThis gives us \n\\hat{E}(Y|A = a*,\\boldsymbol{L})\n\nForth we obtain the focal contrast as the expected difference in the expected average outcomes when exposure at levels a* and a. Where outcomes are continuous we calculate both mean of Y^a and the mean of  Y^{a*} and then obtain their difference.  This gives us: \n\n\\hat{ATE} = \\hat{E}[\\hat{E}(Y|A = a, \\boldsymbol{L}) - \\hat{E}(Y|A = a*, \\boldsymbol{L})]\n\nWhere outcomes are binary, we calculate the causal risk ratio in moving between the different levels of A. Where binary outcomes are more common than 10% we use a log-normal model to calculate a causal rate ratio (VanderWeele, Mathur, and Chen 2020). \nThe stdReg package in R calculates standard errors using the Delta method from which we construct confidence intervals under asymptotic assumptions(Sjölander 2016). Additionally, we pool uncertainty arising from the multiple imputation procedure by employing Rubin’s Rules. \n\n\nAcknowledgements\nWe are grateful to Arvid Sjölander for his help in modifying his stdReg package in R to enable G-computation with multiply-imputed datasets."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Religious traditions span the full bandwidth of human diversity. Despite their differences nearly all religious traditions agree that life’s greatest goods come from virtuous living. Moreover, religious traditions hold that the practice of religion is itself a virtue. For example, in classical Christian thought, religion is the virtue of gratitude to God (Aquinas 1702). Might the causes and consequences of virtuous living form the object of scientific inquiry? And if so, for whom might such a science prove interesting?\nThis article has three objectives.\nFirst, I consider credible objections to the proposal that the causes and consequences of virtuous living can form the objects of scientific study.\n\nSecond, I argue for a pragmatic position that (1) accepts the credible objections against a scientific study of virtue ; (2) remains open to the possibility that the scientific study of virtue may prove interesting, and even edifying, for both scientific and religious audiences.\nFinally, I reflect on specifically how the scientific study of virtue might prove interesting or even edifying to scientific and religious audiences.\nI will restrict my interest to to the promise, and perils, of national-scale longitudinal psychology. I focus on longitudional psychology because it is the science I know best through my experiences as a researcher for the New Zealand Attitudes and Values Study (NZAVS)."

    "title": "On the Measurement of Virtue using National-scale Panel Data",
    "section": "Objections to virtue science",
    "text": "Objections to virtue science\nConsider the following credible objections against a psychological science of virtue.\nThe first credible to the psychological science of virtue is conceptual. Psychological scientists study how people think and behave. However, in classical philosophical and religious reflection, virtue is presented as a skill. As such, virtue is subject both to deficiencies and excesses. For example, Aristotle held that deficiency in the virtue of courage is cowardice and the excess in the virtue of courage is rashness. Aristotle also held that deficiency in the virtue of temperance is indulgence and its excess is insensibility (Pakaluk 2005). If virtue is a skill, to perceive virtue would require, at least in some cases, to possess the virtue. Consider an analogy to music. To assess the quality of a jazz musician requires competence in the genre of Jazz. Although we may study jazz from a behavioral or cognitive perspective such a study would not carry us to an appreciation of excellence in the genre. Similarly, it is unclear how the scientific study of human thought and behavior would carry us to an appreciation of moral excellence. A rash scientist might judge rash behavior as courageous. If religion is indeed a virtue, one that is prone to excesses and deficiencies, then the qualities that distinguish the virtue of religion from, say, the vices of idolatry or indifference, might not be available to scientific inquiry.\nA second credible challenge to the psychological science of virtue is practical. Suppose that virtue is not hidden to science. Nevertheless, it is credible that we might not be able to describe virtue in a language of scientific measurement. William James writes, “Philosophy lives in words, but truth and fact well up into our lives in ways that exceed verbal formulation. There is in the living act of perception always something that glimmers and twinkles and will not be caught, and for which reflection comes too late” (James 1902, 456–57). A similar observation might be made about the scientific study of virtue. Is the recognition of virtue something that can be characterised in the language of science? If virtue pertains to experiences that are poorly represented in human language, it would seem that science will inevitably misconceive the experiential qualities of virtue as it is experienced.\nA third credible challenge to the psychological science of virtue relates to the scope of psychological science. The gold standard for research design in psychological science is an idealised “random experiment.” Assignment to a treatment condition or a control condition is by change. An average response is taken withing groups. If the average response differs by condition, we say that the treatment has a causal effect. As mentioned, the inference one obtains from a randomised experiment pertains to the average response. Unless the population is homogenous in its response, there will be those individuals who respond higher as well as those that respond lower than average (Bulbulia 2022; Hernan and Robins 2023). Although the average response is the Holy Grail of psychological science, teachers and students of virtue typically want to know what works for specific individuals. It would therefore seem that the psychological science of virtue holds limited practical interest.\nNotice that I did not consider the objection that science assumes that virtue is unreal. I will return to this consideration below."

    "section": "Responses to objections",
    "text": "Responses to objections\nI describe the preceding objections to a psychological science of virtue as “credible” because they are persuasive and we should believe them. A psychological science of virtue must begin with a sober appreciation of what the science cannot deliver.\nFirst, a psychological science of virtue cannot substitute for the cultivation of virtue. Just as a medical doctor need not be physically fit to heal, so too psychological scientists need not be virtuous to study virtue. Longitudinal psychology measures people over time. It systematically investigates how beliefs and habits affect people. However, a researcher can no more lay claim to asserting virtue than a tap recorder can lay claim to musical virtuosity. Once recorded, however, it might be possible for musical experts to spot virtuosity.\nSecond, we must appreciate that psychological science of virtue is limited in the scope of knowledge that it can afford. However, knowledge may grow without reaching its limit. We would set too high an expectation on science if we to require that it captures more than a small fraction of what makes virtue worthwhile.\nThird, we must recognise that longitudinal psychological science investigates average effects in populations. There is no psychological science of individual-level causes and effects. Teachers and students of virtues should indeed be weary of thoughtlessly applying the results of any scientific study of virtue to some practical task. However, here again the average response might nevertheless prove interesting and afford some guidance. For example, we know that on average medically approved vaccines help more people than they harm. Some unlucky people will suffer worse harms from taking vaccine that they would have had they abstained. Nevertheless, must of us will hedge our bets, noticing that a far greater number of people are harmed from abstaining. We roll the dice, but the dice are loaded in our favor. It remains an open question whether the study of average effects might prove useful.\nIf the arguments against a psychological science of virtue are taken as sensible limitations on the boundaries of what it might deliver, I believe that the psychological science of virtue can be interesting and indeed edifying. To make this case it is useful to describe how a psychological science of virtue might work."

    "section": "Conclusions",
    "text": "Conclusions\nThe science of virtue, including the virtue of religion, is limited. However, I hope I have convinced you productive conversations about religion and spirituality can benefit from evidence-based science. Lacking such a science, questions about which spiritual habits make life good, and why, are limited by the scope of our individual experiences. By summing over the experiences of many individuals we may broaden our scope of understanding. Longitudinal psychology is particularly helpful because change in people happens we age, through a combination of personal experiences and life circumstances. Yet where religion and spirituality fits into this mix is difficult to ascertain. People vary in their beliefs and habits, as well as in their character, resolve, hope, and resilience. Such differences are not independent of each other, nor of our life experiences and circumstances. How we are now affects what we will eventually become. Like the curvature of the earth or the orbits of planets, the principles at underpin human flourishing await a systematic science. Such a systematic science of religion and spirituality has proved elusive because the relevant datasets have only recently been constructed. For a systematic science of human flourishing, many lives must be measured over many years, and researchers must ask the right questions. A longitudinal science of spirituality and human flourishing takes a bold yet patient approach, seeking to collect such spirituality and flourishing data by repeatedly measuring the same individuals over many years."

Although religious people are a minority in New Zealand, for most of New Zealand’s colonial history there has been a religious majority. Because the decline in religious identification is less than 1% annually, the proportion of religious proportion year-to-year is not substantially different (Hoverd et al. 2015). Like the receding of a glacier, the decline of the religious minority is not readily apparent to the naked eye.

Moreover, the bulk of prejudice research occurs in North America where the religiously identified remain a majority.\nSecond, there are philosophers and theologians. If we assume that good philosophy and theology must be grounded in the facts, it would seem important to include a growing religious minority in philosophical and theological reflection about prejudice.\nThird, there are members of religious communities, including clergy.

It has been conjectured that people turn to religion at times of severe crisis. According to a crisis-conversion model, it would be expected that the earthquakes, which destroyed over thirty percent of New Zealand’s third largest city and dozens of churches, would nevertheless become associated with an upsurge in religious conversion. Would Christchurch show a steeper decline in religious affiliates? One might thing so. The earthquakes destroyed over thirty churches in the region, including the Catholic Basilica and the Anglican Cathedral. Would faith fall with its cathedrals? Because the NZAVS had measured people across the country longitudinal data enabled NZAVS researchers to test the theoretical predictions of long-debated functional theories of religion (Sibley and Bulbulia 2012).\nConsistent with census measures, the NZAVS analysis found an annual decline in religious affiliation across New Zealand population of .09% between 2009 and 2011. In accordance with the crisis- conversion model, NZAVS researchers observed a net increase of 3.4% religious affiliates in the Christchurch region, as well as among those who reported being affected by the earthquakes. This entirely reversed the existing, longstanding, and highly predictable trend to apostasy in New Zealand. In this way, longitudinal data from individuals assessed before and after this natural disaster was able to afford the first quantifiable evidence consistent with the crisis-conversion model.\nReligion was more appealing in Christchurch after the earthquakes. Might religious membership also buffer the faithful from declines in subjective well- being? To address this second question, we compared subjective health in Christchurch before and after the earthquakes with subjective health in the rest of New Zealand. Focusing on religious people, NZAVS researchrs found that those who maintained their faith did not experience declines in subjective well-being. NZAVS researchers also found that people who were already secular in 2009 were similarly buffered in their subjective well being when assessed in 2011. This result suggested that both religious and secular people, on average, found similar levels of support in the wake of this natural disaster, as assessed by subjective health. NZAVS researchers found that those who lost faith outside of Christchurch retained similar levels of subjective health over this same period, suggesting that the loss of religion per se is not associated with declines to subjective well-being. However in Christchurch, and among those affected by the earthquakes, we found marked declines in the subjective health of those who disaffiliated.\nOverall, the NZAVS research suggests that the experience of the earthquakes combined with a loss of faith to elaborate poorer subjective well-being in the earthquake zone. What explains this association? Did excessive hardship cause a loss of faith or did a loss of faith without secular support expose apostates to poorer subjective health? Our data cannot answer this question. As is typical of hypothesis-driven research, though results clarify some questions, results also raise others."

    "text": "Credible objections about the limits of virtue science should be accepted, however virtue science may remain interesting and edifying\nI describe the preceding objections to a psychological science of virtue as “credible” because they are persuasive and we should believe them. A psychological science of virtue must begin with a sober appreciation of what the science cannot deliver.\nFirst, a psychological science of virtue cannot substitute for the cultivation of virtue. Just as a medical doctor need not be physically fit to heal, so too psychological scientists need not be virtuous to study virtue. Longitudinal psychology measures people over time. It systematically investigates how beliefs and habits affect people. However, a researcher can no more lay claim to asserting virtue than a tap recorder can lay claim to musical virtuosity. Once recorded, however, it might be possible for musical experts to spot virtuosity.\nSecond, we must appreciate that psychological science of virtue is limited in the scope of knowledge that it can afford. However, knowledge may grow without reaching its limit. We would set too high an expectation on science if we to require that it captures more than a small fraction of what makes virtue worthwhile.\nThird, we must recognise that longitudinal psychological science investigates average effects in populations. There is no psychological science of individual-level causes and effects. Teachers and students of virtues should indeed be weary of thoughtlessly applying the results of any scientific study of virtue to some practical task. However, here again the average response might nevertheless prove interesting and afford some guidance. For example, we know that on average medically approved vaccines help more people than they harm. Some unlucky people will suffer worse harms from taking vaccine that they would have had they abstained. Nevertheless, must of us will hedge our bets, noticing that a far greater number of people are harmed from abstaining. We roll the dice, but the dice are loaded in our favor. It remains an open question whether the study of average effects might prove useful.\nIf the arguments against a psychological science of virtue are taken as sensible limitations on the boundaries of what it might deliver, I believe that the psychological science of virtue can be interesting and indeed edifying. To make this case it is useful to describe how a psychological science of virtue might work."

There are practical limitations to what the data can demonstrate.\n\nThe implications of the Christchurch Earthquake Study rely on assumptions\n\n\nInterest for human scientists\nNew information may affect prior beliefs. Remarkably, a mathematical theorem, “Bayes Theorem”, enables us to quantify the degree to which new information should rationally revise prior convictions. Elsewhere I have described the relevance of Bayes Theorem to the philosophy of religion (, J. 2013). Here, it is sufficient to note that there Bayes Theorem shows that one ought to change one’s beliefs in proportion to one’s surprise at new evidence.\n\n\\Pr(Hypothesis|Evidence) \\propto \\Pr(Evidence|Hypothesis)\\Pr(Hypothesis)\n\nWhen reasoning about any implication of the Christchurch Earth – whether this implication is scientific, theological, practical – it is helpful to consider Bayes theorem. In plain terms, the theorem states that our revised belief in the hypothesis after observing the new evidence \\Pr(Hypothesis| Evidence) is a function of the prior likelihood of the observing the evidence condition on the hypothesis \\Pr(Evidence|Hypothesis) multiple by the prior probability we hold the hypothesis to be true \\Pr(Hypothesis)\nFirst, consider the consolation conversion hypothesis, which predicts that natural disasters will draw people to faith. We observe greater religious conversion in Christchurch, as we would expect where the crisis conversion hypothesis true \\Pr(Evidence|Hypothesis). However, other scientific theories predict religious conversion during times of crisis but do not claim that religion functions to provide consolation. For example, moral-functional theories argue religion functions to increase cooperation (Botero et al. 2014). If one accorded a low prior probability in the consolation theory of religion, but a high probability to the moral functional theory of religion, the evidence for religious conversion in Christchurch would not affect one’s posterior beliefs. Both theories predict conversion a crisis. However, the crisis-conversion theory of religion predicts greater buffering from religious affiliation, which was not observed. The extent to which one should revise one’s prior beliefs in this crisis-conversion model depends on how surprised one at the evidence. The observed distress among those who lost their religious faith provides some evidence for a crisis-consolation model. However, a moral-functional theorist of religion might interpret such destress as a nudging to a religious community. We have already noted that the grain of the longitudinal data can disentangle the temporal ordering of distress and loss of faith. Although Bayes theorem describes how much people should shift in their beliefs, how much one should change is a function of how surprised one would be by the observations.\nThat there was greater conversion in Christchurch is inconsistent with the predicted downward trend that is observed elsewhere. The probability that this observation is accidental is small. Why was religion more attractive after the earthquakes? Why was it attractive despite offering no support for subjective well-being? These are questions are topics for future scientific inquiry.\n\n\nInterest for theologians\nEarlier, I mentioned that one may object to a science of virtue as irrelevant to understanding virtue because science assumes that virtue is unreal. I furthermore claimed that this is not a credible objection. We are not in a better position to understand why.\nFirst, as I mentioned at the outset, across most religious traditions consider religion to be a virtue. If we accept this position, then the study of religious change may help to clarify the causes and consequences of the virtue of religion. If we were not to accept the proposition that religion is a virtue then the study of religious change might appear out of place in the a discussion about the causes and consequences of virtue. If we were not to believe in virtue, then the study of religious change would simply be the study of change in certain beliefs, habits, and affiliations. The science itself does not tell us which position to accept. Here too our interpretations are a function of our prior commitments. How scientific undestanding affects our understanding of virtue is in part a function of our prior commitments. This a not a bug it is a feature.\nFor example, on Aquinas’s conceptions of religion as virtue of gratitude, we would not expect that the expression of religion would necessarily lead to greater subjective well-being. For Aquinas, the virtue of religion is meant to orient us to God; we should express this virtue because doing so is good. Put differently, for Aquinas, the benefits of religion are not extrinsic goods such as greater self-reports of well-being. Rather the benefit of religion is an as intrinsic good, the understand of which arises from being and doing good.\nJust as scientists may update their prior beliefs about a theory in light of new scientific discoveries, so to may philosophers and theologians update their prior philosophies in light of new scientific discoveries. What the “nudging” to religion in the wake of this natural disaster a nudging to an expression of gratitude to God? Did the destruction of churches give rise to new forms of religious community. It depends on our prior assumptions. However, that we are prompted to such questions is only made possible by a science that tracks religious change over time. Were the data not collected we could not know whether there was religious change after the Christchurch earthquakes, and how this change was affected."

    "section": "Credible objections to virtue science",
    "text": "Credible objections to virtue science\nIf the cultivation of virtue, including the virtue of religion, indeed makes life good, and if the good in life is apparent, then the causes and consequences of virtue should be observable and amenable to scientific study. However, there are at least three credible objections against the psychological science of virtue.\nThe first credible objection is conceptual. Psychological scientists study how people think and behave. Yet, philosophers and theologians conceive of virtue as a skill. Aristotle held that deficiency in the virtue of courage is cowardice and the excess in the virtue of courage is rashness . Aristotle also argued that deficiency in the virtue of temperance is an indulgence, and its excess is insensibility (Aristotle and others 1984). If virtue were a skill, to perceive virtue might require, at least in some cases, possession of virtue. Consider an analogy to music. Assessing a jazz musician’s quality requires competence in the genre of jazz. Although we may study jazz from a behavioural or cognitive perspective, such a study would not carry us to an appreciation of excellence in the genre. Similarly, it has yet to be determined how the scientific study of human thought and behaviour would carry us to an appreciation of moral excellence. A rash scientist might judge impulsive behaviour as courageous. If religion were indeed a virtue that is prone to excesses and deficiencies, then the qualities that distinguish the virtue of religion from, say, the vices of idolatry or indifference might not be available to scientific inquiry.\nA second credible challenge to the psychological science of virtue is practical. Suppose that virtue is not hidden to science. Nevertheless, it is conceivable that scientists might not be able to describe virtue in a language of scientific measurement. William James writes, “Philosophy lives in words, but truth and fact well up into our lives in ways that exceed verbal formulation. There is in the living act of perception always something that glimmers and twinkles and will not be caught, and for which reflection comes too late” (James 1902, 456–57). A similar observation applies to the scientific study of virtue. If virtue pertains to experiences that are poorly represented in human language, science will inevitably misconceive the experiential qualities of virtue.\nA third credible challenge to the psychological science of virtue relates to the scope of psychological science. The gold standard for research design in psychological science is an idealised “random experiment.” Assignment to a treatment condition or a control condition is by chance. An average response is taken within groups. If the average response differs by condition, we say the treatment has a causal effect. As mentioned, the inference from a randomised experiment pertains to the average response. Unless the population is homogenous in its response, there will be those individuals who respond higher and those who respond lower than average (Bulbulia 2022; Hernan and Robins 2023). Although the average response is the Holy Grail of psychological science, teachers and students of virtue typically want to know what works for specific individuals. The psychological science of virtue, it would seem, holds limited practical interest.\nNotice that I did not consider the objection that science assumes that virtue is unreal. I will return to this consideration below. Credible objections about the limits of virtue science should be accepted, however, virtue science may remain interesting and informative I describe the initial objections to a psychological science of virtue as “credible” because they are persuasive, and we should believe them. A psychological science of virtue must begin with a sober appreciation of what the science cannot deliver.\nFirst, a psychological science of virtue cannot substitute for cultivating virtue. Just as a medical doctor need not be physically fit to heal, psychological scientists need not be virtuous to study virtue. Longitudinal psychology measures people over time. It systematically investigates how beliefs and habits affect people. However, a researcher can no more lay claim to asserting virtue than a tap recorder can lay claim to musical virtuosity. However, it might be possible for musical experts to spot virtuosity in a recording, thereby extending their understanding.\nSecond, we must appreciate that the psychological science of virtue is limited in the scope of knowledge that it can afford. However, knowledge may grow without reaching its limit. We would set too high an expectation of science if we were to require that it captures more than a small fraction of what makes virtue worthwhile.\nThird, we must recognise that longitudinal psychological science investigates average population effects. There is no psychological science of individual-level causes and effects (Bulbulia 2022). Teachers and students of virtues should be weary of thoughtlessly applying the results of any scientific study of virtue to some practical task. However, the average response might nevertheless prove interesting and afford some guidance. For example, on average, medically approved vaccines help more people than they harm. Some unlucky people will suffer worse harm from taking the vaccine than if they abstained. Nevertheless, most of us hedge our bets because a far greater proportion experience harm from abstaining. We roll the dice in taking the vaccine, but the dice are loaded in our favour.\nI believe that the psychological science of virtue might be interesting and indeed edifying, both scientifically and theologically. To make this argument, it is useful to describe concretely how a psychological science of virtue might work."

Both theories predict conversion a crisis. However, the crisis-conversion theory of religion predicts greater buffering from religious affiliation, which was not observed. The extent to which one should revise one’s prior beliefs in this crisis-conversion model depends on how surprised one at the evidence. The observed distress among those who lost their religious faith provides some evidence for a crisis-consolation model. However, a moral-functional theorist of religion might interpret such destress as a nudging to a religious community. We have already noted that the grain of the longitudinal data can disentangle the temporal ordering of distress and loss of faith. Although Bayes theorem describes how much people should shift in their beliefs, how much one should change is a function of how surprised one would be by the observations."

    "text": "Introduction\nReligious traditions span the total bandwidth of human diversity. Despite their differences, nearly all religious traditions agree that life’s most significant goods come from virtuous living. Moreover, religious traditions hold that the practice of religion is itself a virtue. For example, in classical Christian thought, religion is the virtue of gratitude to God (Aquinas 1702). Might the causes and consequences of virtuous living form the object of scientific inquiry? And if so, for whom might such a science prove interesting?\nHere, I consider three credible objections to the proposal that the causes and consequences of virtuous living can form the objects of scientific study. I argue for a pragmatic position that (1) accepts the credible objections against a scientific study of virtue ; (2) remains open to the possibility that the scientific study of virtue may prove interesting and even edifying. I then consider an example of a longitudinal psychological study of religion in the aftermath of a natural disaster, which I use to consider reflect on how the scientific study of virtue might prove exciting or even informative to scientific and theological audiences. I restrict my interest to longitudinal psychology because it is the science I know."

    "text": "Credible objections about the limits of virtue science should be accepted, however virtue science may remain interesting and informative\nI describe the initial objections to a psychological science of virtue as “credible” because they are persuasive, and we should believe them. A psychological science of virtue must begin with a sober appreciation of what the science cannot deliver.\nFirst, a psychological science of virtue cannot substitute for cultivating virtue. Just as a medical doctor need not be physically fit to heal, psychological scientists need not be virtuous to study virtue. Longitudinal psychology measures people over time. It systematically investigates how beliefs and habits affect people. However, a researcher can no more lay claim to asserting virtue than a tap recorder can lay claim to musical virtuosity. However, it might be possible for musical experts to spot virtuosity in a recording, thereby extending their understanding.\nSecond, we must appreciate that the psychological science of virtue is limited in the scope of knowledge that it can afford. However, knowledge may grow without reaching its limit. We would set too high an expectation on science if we required that it captures more than a small fraction of what makes virtue worthwhile.\nThird, we must recognise that longitudinal psychological science investigates average population effects. There is no psychological science of individual-level causes and effects. Teachers and students of virtues should be weary of thoughtlessly applying the results of any scientific study of virtue to some practical task. However, the average response might nevertheless prove interesting and afford some guidance. For example, we know that on average, medically approved vaccines help more people than they harm. Some unlucky people will suffer worse harm from taking vaccine than they would have had they abstained. Nevertheless, must of us hedge our bets, noticing that a far greater number of people are harmed from abstaining. We roll the dice, but the dice are loaded in our favour. It remains an open question whether the study of average effects might prove helpful.\nSuppose the arguments against a psychological science of virtue are taken as sensible limitations on the boundaries of what it might deliver. In that case, I believe that the psychological science of virtue can be interesting and indeed edifying. To make this argument, it is useful to concretely describe how a psychological science of virtue might work."

    "text": "Findings from The New Zealand Attitudes and Values Christchurch\nEarthquake Study On February 22, 2011, a M_w 6.2 earthquake struck Christchurch New Zealand, at a shallow depth of only four kilometres. The energy released from the earthquake, combined with the unstable soil conditions in the region, resulted in extreme shaking, widespread damage, and the loss of nearly 200 lives.\nThe earthquake and aftershock sequence occurred between the first and second waves of the New Zealand Attitudes and Values Study (NZAVS). The NZAVS is a national-scale panel study that Professor Chris G. Sibley started at the end of 2009 (NZAVS). A panel study differs from a census, which samples the population over time without tracking individuals. The NZAVS follows the same people annually, measuring health, personality, relationships, employment, behaviours, values, beliefs, and community-making. Because the study obtains information at the level of individuals over time as they age, NZAVS longitudinal data afford researchers insight into how social, cultural, and psychological attributes, together with life events, dynamically affect each other over time.\nThe Christchurch earthquake illustrates the power of longitudinal data to clarify questions about religion’s functions. Specifically, because the participant pool consisted of a national probability sample, it was possible to compare changes in Christchurch with changes in the rest of New Zealand, thus isolating earthquake-specific effects from general trends affecting the entire country. To place this study in its broader historical context, New Zealand has experienced a steady rate of proportional decline in religious affiliates since 1966 of about one per cent of the general population per year (Hoverd et al. 2015).\nPhilosophers conjecture that people turn to religion in crisis for consolation (Freud 2012). The crisis-consolation theory of religion would predict that the Christchurch earthquakes, which destroyed over thirty per cent of New Zealand’s second-largest city and dozens of churches, would cause religious conversions in this region but not others. By contrast, the earthquakes initially destroyed over thirty regional churches, including the Catholic Basilica and the city’s iconic Anglican Cathedral. Did faith fall with these cathedrals? Because the NZAVS had measured people across the country, longitudinal data enabled NZAVS researchers to test the theory of a crisis-consolation model for religion’s functions (Sibley and Bulbulia 2012).\nNZAVS researchers observed the following:\n\nThere was an annual decline in religious affiliation outside the Christchurch region of .09%. This decline replicated census estimates of a 1% yearly decline in religion.\nDuring this same period, there was a net increase of 3.4% in religious affiliates in the Christchurch region. Thus, there was a considerable religious conversion in Christchurch. This finding accords with the prediction of a crisis-consolation model for religion’s functions, which predicts that greater demand for faith will lead to a higher conversion rate.\nIn Christchurch and elsewhere, those who maintained their religious affiliation before did not experience a decline in subjective well-being.\nPeople who were already secular in 2009 were similarly buffered in their subjective well-being when assessed in 2011. This finding implies that there were material resources for psychological consolation that was at least strong, on average, as were religious resources for psychological buffering.\nIn Christchurch, but not outside of Christchurch, those who lost religious faith experienced a decline in subjective well-being. However, outside of Christchurch, there were no declines in the subjective health of those who disaffiliated.\n\nOverall, the NZAVS findings implied that the loss of faith combined with experiences of the earthquakes causing poorer subjective well-being. Unfortunately the data do not clarify whether excessive hardship caused a loss of faith or whether the loss of faith without secular support exposed religious disaffiliates to poorer subjective health."

If our prior beliefs accord reasonably well with the observed evidence there is unlikely to be much revision demanded of us. However where our expectations differ from observations we should revise our beliefs in proportion to our surprise.\nThis much is clear: the observed increase in conversion in the earthquake affected regions is inconsistent with the predicted downward trend that is observed elsewhere. Why was religion more psychologically attractive to those who experienced the earthquakes? The science here remains inconclusive. Part of the interest of this science is that it motivates future inquiry into the psychological mechanisms that underpin conversion."
