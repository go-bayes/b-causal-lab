    "text": "Confounding occurs when the statistical association between indicators in the data do not reflect a causal association between parameters in a target population. A causal graph is a qualitative tool that enables us to quickly inspect sources of confounding.\nWe may represent our strategy for confounding control using the causal graph presented in Figure 1.\nWe define an exposure or treatment by $A$. We define \\boldsymbol{Y} as the set of all well-being outcomes contained in the NZAVS. Our interest is in consistently estimating the causal effect of congregation size on each of these outcomes. To consistently estimate the causal effect of an exposure A=1 on the vector of well-being outcomes \\boldsymbol{Y} we must ensure that we have included a set of confounders that will prevent any statistical association between A and Y in the absence of causation. A statistical association in the absence of a causal association may arise in one of three ways.: (1) A and Y share a common cause. (2) A and Y share a common effect. (3) There is confounding by descent, such that conditioning on a confounder introduces a statistical association between A and Y in the absence of a casual association (collider bias).\nTo address challenge (1) we may condition or stratify on all measured common causes of A and Y. To address challenges (2) and (3), we must not condition on any effect or desendent of an effect. Note however that by conditioning on a descent of a common cause we may at least partially address conditioning by a common cause. This is because conditioning on the effect of a common cause may itself partially block the effect of the that common cause.\nHere, we use a modified version of VanderWeele et al’s approach to estimate causal effects using three waves of NZAVS panel data (VanderWeele, Mathur, and Chen 2020).\nCall t-1 the baseline wave, t_0 the exposure wave, and t+1 the outcome measurement wave. First, we include at baseline indicators of all past outcomes \\boldsymbol{Y}_{t-1}. Second, we include at baseline an indicator for the past exposure A_{t-1}. Third, we include a rich set of baseline confounders \\boldsymbol{L_{t-1}}. Of course, we cannot ensure that this strategy is sufficient to ensure no unmeasured confounding. However, on On VanderWeele’s strategy, for any unmeasured confounder to affect both the exposure/outcome association, it would need to do so independently of its effects on prior measurements of the exposure and (all) outcomes at baseline, in addition to all measured baseline confounders. Note also that by controlling for measured confounders the wave prior to exposure we avoid unwittingly conditioning on an effects of the exposure that subsequently affects the outcome – mediator bias. Note furthermore that by measuring the outcome in the year following the exposure, Y_{t+1}, we ensure that the exposure temporally precedes the outcome, and is not, for example, an effect of the outcome. Finally, loss-to-follow-up or attrition, as well as survey non-response may introduce selection bias (represented by the boxed S_{t+1}). There are several ways in which uch selection bias may introduce confounding. In Figure 1, we note the prospect in which a novel common cause of A and Y called U_s may lead to a spurious association between A and Y if S is a collider of A and U_s. To avoid selection bias we multiply impute the missing responses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nVanderWeele, Tyler J, Maya B Mathur, and Ying Chen. 2020. “Outcome-Wide Longitudinal Designs for Causal Inference: A New Template for Empirical Studies.” Statistical Science 35 (3): 437466.\n\nReuseCC BY-NC-SACitationBibTeX citation:@online{bulbulia2022,\n  author = {Joseph Bulbulia},\n  title = {Outcome-Wide {Causal} {Inference} in the {NZAVS}},\n  date = {2022-11-02},\n  url = {https://go-bayes.github.io/b-causal-lab/},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nJoseph Bulbulia. 2022. “Outcome-Wide Causal Inference in the\nNZAVS.” November 2, 2022. https://go-bayes.github.io/b-causal-lab/."

    "text": "Causal inference\nConsider a binary exposure A with two levels, A = 0 and A=1 and a continuous outcome Y.  Estimating the causal effect of A on outcome Y requires contrasting two states of the world.  Y when, perhaps contrary to fact, A is set to 1, or Y|A=1, which we write as {a=1},Y and secondly Y when, perhaps contrary to fact, A is set to 0, or Y|A =1 which we may write asY^{a=0}. We say that A affects Y  when the quantitiesY^{a=1} - Y^{a=0} \\neq 0.   Note that, at any given time, at most only one level of the exposure A may be realised for any individual. That is, Y^{a=1} and Y^{a=0} are never simultaneously observed in any individual.  As such, individual-level causal effects are not typically identifiable from data. It is for this reason that we refer to the Y^{a=1} and Y^{a=0} as “potential” or “counterfactual” outcomes. However, when certain conditions are satisfied we may identify the average or marginal causal effects at the level of groups of individuals who are experience different levels of exposure.  We say there is an average or marginal causal effect if the difference of the averages of the population who are exposed and unexposed does not equal zero:  E(Y^{a=1}) - E(Y^{a=0})\\neq 0 , or because the difference of the means is equivalent to the mean of the differences, if E(Y^{a=1} - Y^{a=0})\\neq 0.  This contrast in tje expected average of the counterfactual outcomes is the marginal effect. Here, our example uses a binary exposure but we may contrast the counterfactual outcomes for two levels of a continuous exposure. To do this we must state the levels of exposure at which we seek comparisons. \nCrtitically, to ensure valid inference, we need to ensure that the potential outcomes are independent of the exposures received, namely: \nY^a  \\perp\\!\\!\\!\\perp A|L\nOr equivalently:\nA \\perp\\!\\!\\!\\perp Y^a |L\nIf we have have only observational data, we cannot generally ensure that the exposures are independent of the counterfactual outcomes. For this reason, we use sensitivity analyis such at the calculating an E-value to assess the robustness of any result to unmeasured confounding (VanderWeele and Ding 2017)."

To avoid implausible assumptions of linearity we model the relationship between the exposure each of the potential outcomes of interest using a cubic spline.  We include in the set of baseline confounders \\boldsymbol{L} the baseline measure of the exposure as well as the baseline response (or responses): \\{A\\_{t-1}, \\boldsymbol{Y_{t-1}} = (Y_{1, t-1}, Y_{2, t-1}, Y_{3, t-1}\\dots Y_{n, t-1})\\} \\subset \\boldsymbol{L}.  \n\nThis model give us E(Y|A, \\boldsymbol{L})\n\nSecond, we use the model in (1) to predict the values of a potential outcome Y^{a} by setting the exposure to the value A = a.\n\nThis model gives us \\hat{E}(Y|A = a, \\boldsymbol{L})\n\nThird, we use the model in (1) to predict the values of a different potential outcome Y^{a*}by setting the exposure to a different value of A =a^{\\star}.\n\nThis model gives us  \\hat{E}(Y|A = a*,\\boldsymbol{L})\n\nForth we obtain the focal contrast as the expected difference in the expected average outcomes when exposure at levels a* and a.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Religions spans the bandwidth of human diversity. Despite their differences, nearly all religions agree that greatest goods in life come from virtuous living. Moreover, in classical Christian thought, religion itself is a virtue. Religion consists of acts and prayers that appropriately acknowledge God as the source of our existence and continuance (Aquinas 1702).\nIf the cultivation of virtue, including the virtue of religion, indeed makes life good, and the good in life is apparent, then, in theory, the causes and consequences of virtue should be amenable to scientific study.\nThis article has three objectives.\nFirst, I consider credible objections that the causes and consequences of virtuous living cannot form the object of scientific study.\nSecond, I motivate a pragmatic position that accepts the credible objections against a scientific study of virtue but which nevertheless allows that, when appropriately bounded, a scientific study of virtue may prove interesting and even edifying. Here, I describe an approach that leverages the repeated measurement of individuals in large national cohort studies over the course of their lifespans. This approach belongs to what Tyler VanderWeele calls “outcome-wide longitudinal flourishing science” (VanderWeele, Mathur, and Chen 2020). I focus on outcome-wide longitudinal psychology because it is what I use in my research as a member of the senior leadership team for the New Zealand Attitudes and Values Study (NZAVS).\nFinally, I consider three different audiences for whom the scientific study of virtue, in the form of outcome-wide longitudinal flourishing science, might prove interesting and edifying: (1) human scientists; (2) theologians; (3) teachers and clergy."

    "title": "On the Measurement of Virtue using National-scale Panel Data",
    "section": "Objections to virtue science",
    "text": "Objections to virtue science\nConsider the following credible objections against a psychological science of virtue.\nPsychological scientists study how people think and behave. However, in classical philosophical and religious reflection, virtue is conceived of as a skill, and the expression of a virtue is subject both to deficiencies and excesses. For example, Aristotle held that the deficiency of courage is cowardice and the excess of courage is rashness; the deficiency of temperance is indulgence and the excess of temperance is insensibility. Notably, to judge a behavior as virtuous or vicious would appear to require that one possesses the relevant virtue. Here we may draw an analogy to music. To assess the quality of a jazz musician requires competence in the genre. Although we may study jazz from a behavioral or cognitive perspective such a study would not carry us to an appreciation of excellence in the genre. Similarly, it is unclear how the study of human thought and behaviour would carry us to an appreciation of moral excellence. Which thoughts and behaviours should form the topic of the interest? What should one consider when measuring these thoughts and behaviours? What are the marks of virtue? How is such virtue to be distinguished from vice?\nA second, related challenge to the psychological science of virtue is practical, namely that virtue pertains to experiences which may be poorly represented in human language. In the Varieties of Religious Experience, William James writes, “Philosophy lives in words, but truth and fact well up into our lives in ways that exceed verbal formulation. There is in the living act of perception always something that glimmers and twinkles and will not be caught, and for which reflection comes too late” (James 1902, 456–57). Even if we could recognise virtue when we perceive it, how might we speak of it? Consider again the analogy to jazz music. A complete behavioural and cognitive explanation of jazz could not arguable substitute an understanding and appreciation of the art form. Similarly, all classical traditions conceive of the cultivation and expression of the virtues as a form of art or skill.\nA third credible challenge to the psychological science of virtue arises from an appreciation that psychological science investigates average effects in a population or sub-population. The gold standard for research design in psychological science is the idealised “random experiment.” In such a design, a researcher assigns individuals by chance to either a treatment condition or a control condition, and subsequently investigates the average response across individuals within each condition. If responses differ by condition, we say that the treatment has a causal effect. Notably, the inference one obtains from a randomised experiment pertains to the average response. That is, the experiment summarises causal effects across individuals. As with any average, there will be those individuals who respond better or worse than the average (Bulbulia 2022; Hernan and Robins 2023). Although the average response is the holy grail of psychological science, teachers and students of virtue typically want to know what works for individuals."

    "text": "Responses to objections\nI describe the preceding arguments against a psychological science of virtue as “credible” because they are persuasive and we should believe them. The psychological science of virtue must begin with a sober appreciation of what the science cannot deliver. First, they psychological science of virtue cannot substitute for the cultivation of virtue. Second, the psychological science of virtue is limited in the scope of knowledge that it can afford: science too “volleys in vocables.” Third, longitudinal psychological science investigates average effects in populations and sub-populations. There is no psychological science of individual-level causes and effects. Teachers and students of virtues should be weary when apply the results of any scientific study of virtue to some practical task. Note that sober restraint in generalising arises in the best-case scenerios when the science correctly estimates population averages. Science is imperfect, and it progresses slowly and incrementally. A healthy falliabilism, too, warrents restraint.\nIf these limitations are kept in mind, I believe that the psychological science of virtue can be interesting and indeed edifying. To make this case it will be useful to describe how a psychological science of virtue might work."

Although religious people are a minority in New Zealand, for most of New Zealand’s colonial history there has been a religious majority. Because the decline in religious identification is less than 1% annually, the proportion of religious proportion year-to-year is not substantially different (Hoverd et al. 2015). Like the receding of a glacier, the decline of the religious minority is not readily apparent to the naked eye. Although these facts may help to explain the poverty of research on anti-religious prejudice, they do not provide excuses for ignoring it."

There has been considerable scientific attention to study of prejudice against historically marginalised groups. However, in countries such as New Zealand, religious people have only recently become the minority. Moreover, the bulk of prejudice research occurs in North America where the religiously identified remain a majority.\nSecond, there are philosophers and theologians. If we assume that good philosophy and theology must be grounded in the facts, it would seem important to include a growing religious minority in philosophical and theological reflection about prejudice.\nThird, there are members of religious communities, including clergy.
