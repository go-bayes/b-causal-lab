    "text": "Causal inference\nConsider a binary exposure A with two levels, A = 0 and A=1 and a continuous outcome Y.  Estimating the causal effect of A on outcome Y requires contrasting two states of the world.  Y when, perhaps contrary to fact, A is set to 1, or Y|A=1, which we write as {a=1},Y and secondly Y when, perhaps contrary to fact, A is set to 0, or Y|A =1 which we may write asY^{a=0}. We say that A affects Y  when the quantitiesY^{a=1} - Y^{a=0} \\neq 0.   Note that, at any given time, at most only one level of the exposure A may be realised for any individual. That is, Y^{a=1} and Y^{a=0} are never simultaneously observed in any individual.  As such, individual-level causal effects are not typically identifiable from data. It is for this reason that we refer to the Y^{a=1} and Y^{a=0} as “potential” or “counterfactual” outcomes. However, when certain conditions are satisfied we may identify the average or marginal causal effects at the level of groups of individuals who are experience different levels of exposure.  We say there is an average or marginal causal effect if the difference of the averages of the population who are exposed and unexposed does not equal zero:  E(Y^{a=1}) - E(Y^{a=0})\\neq 0 , or because the difference of the means is equivalent to the mean of the differences, if E(Y^{a=1} - Y^{a=0})\\neq 0.  This contrast in tje expected average of the counterfactual outcomes is the marginal effect. Here, our example uses a binary exposure but we may contrast the counterfactual outcomes for two levels of a continuous exposure. To do this we must state the levels of exposure at which we seek comparisons. \nCrtitically, to ensure valid inference, we need to ensure that the potential outcomes are independent of the exposures received, namely: \nY^a  \\perp\\!\\!\\!\\perp A|L\nOr equivalently:\nA \\perp\\!\\!\\!\\perp Y^a |L\nIf we have have only observational data, we cannot generally ensure that the exposures are independent of the counterfactual outcomes. For this reason, we use sensitivity analyis such at the calculating an E-value to assess the robustness of any result to unmeasured confounding (VanderWeele and Ding 2017)."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Religion spans the full bandwidth of human diversity. Despite this diversity, nearly all religions agree that greatest goods in life come from virtuous living. Indeed, in classical Christian thought, religion itself is a virtue. Religion consists of acts and prayers that appropriately acknowledge God as the source of our existence and continuance (Aquinas 1702).\nIf the cultivation of virtue, including the virtue of religion, indeed makes life good, then in theory the effects virtuous living should be observable. If such effects are observable, then in theory they should be measurable. If the effects of virtuous living are measurable, then in theory, such effects should be amenable to scientific study.\nThis article has three objectives.\nFirst, I consider credible objections to the proposition that virtue, including the virtue of religion, can form the object of scientific study.\nSecond, I consider a pragmatic argument for the scientific study of virtue as interesting despite the credible objections raised against it. Here, I describe an approach that leverages the repeated measurement of individuals in large national cohort studies over the course of their lifespans. This approach belongs to what Tyler VanderWeele calls outcomewide longitudinal flourishing science (VanderWeele, Mathur, and Chen 2020).\nFinally, I consider three audiences for whom the scientific study of virtue might be interesting: (1) human scientists; (2) theologians; (3) teachers and clergy.\nHere, I restrict focus to the psychological science of virtue. There are, of course, other sciences that may be relevant, such as economics, sociology, and archaeology. It is an open question whether consideration of challenges and opportunities of a psychological science of virtue generalise to other scientific domains. At any rate, the field about which I am most familiar."

    "section": "Objections to measuring virtue",
    "text": "Objections to measuring virtue\nConsider the following credible objections to a psychological science of virtue.\nPsychological scientists study how people think and behave. However, in classical philosophical and religious reflection, virtue is conceived of as a skill, and the expression of a virtue is subject both to deficiencies and excesses. For example, Aristotle held that the deficiency of courage is cowardice and the excess of courage is rashness; the deficiency of temperance is indulgence and the excess of temperance is insensibility. Notably, to judge a behavior as virtuous or vicious would appear to require that one possesses the relevant virtue. Here we may draw an analogy to music. To assess the quality of a jazz musician requires competence in the genre. Although we may study jazz from a behavioral or cognitive perspective such a study would not carry us to an appreciation of excellence in the genre. Similarly, it is unclear how the study of human thought and behaviour would carry us to an appreciation of moral excellence. Which thoughts and behaviours should form the topic of the interest? What should one consider when measuring these thoughts and behaviours? What are the marks of virtue? How is such virtue to be distinguished from vice?\nA second, related challenge to the psychological science of virtue is practical, namely that virtue pertains to experiences which may be poorly represented in human language. In the Varieties of Religious Experience, William James writes, “Philosophy lives in words, but truth and fact well up into our lives in ways that exceed verbal formulation. There is in the living act of perception always something that glimmers and twinkles and will not be caught, and for which reflection comes too late” (James 1902, 456–57). Even if we could recognise virtue when we perceive it, how might we speak of it? Consider again the analogy to jazz music. A complete behavioural and cognitive explanation of jazz could not arguable substitute an understanding and appreciation of the art form. Similarly, all classical traditions conceive of the cultivation and expression of the virtues as a form of art or skill.\nA third credible challenge to a psychological science of virtue relates to the appreciation that psychological science investigates average effects. The idealised “random experiment” is the gold standard of psychological design. We use chance to assign individuals to either a treatment or a control condition, and investigate the average response within each condition. If these responses differ, we say that the treatment has a causal effect. However, the inference pertains to the average response. Within each condition may be those who respond better or worse than average, or who do not respond at all (Bulbulia 2022; Hernan and Robins 2023). Although the average response is the holy grail of psychological science, teachers and learners of virtue will want to know what works for individuals."

    "text": "Responses to objections\nI describe the preceding arguments against a psychological science of virtue as “credible” because I believe them. The psychological science of virtue should begin with a sober appreciation of what the science can deliver.\nFirst, a psychological science of virtue cannot substitute for the cultivation of virtue.\nSecond, a psychological science of virtue is limited in the scope of knowledge that it can afford.\nThird, psychological science investigates average effects across populations and sub-populations. There is no science of individual-level effect. Teachers and learners of virtues should be weary of generalising to individuals."

Although religious people are a minority in New Zealand, for most of New Zealand’s colonial history there has been a religious majority. Because the decline in religious identification is less than 1% annually, the proportion of religious proportion year-to-year is not substantially different (Hoverd et al. 2015). Like the receding of a glacier, the decline of the religious minority is not readily apparent to the naked eye. Although these facts may help to explain the poverty of research on anti-religious prejudice, they do not provide excuses for ignoring it."

There has been considerable scientific attention to study of prejudice against historically marginalised groups. However, in countries such as New Zealand, religious people have only recently become the minority. Moreover, the bulk of prejudice research occurs in North America where the religiously identified remain a majority.\nSecond, there are philosophers and theologians. If we assume that good philosophy and theology must be grounded in the facts, it would seem important to include a growing religious minority in philosophical and theological reflection about prejudice.\nThird, there are members of religious communities, including clergy. If the study of anti-religious prejudice reveals that many religious people are indeed experiencing greater prejudice religious communities should want to know."
