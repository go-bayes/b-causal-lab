    "text": "Causal inference\nConsider a binary exposure A with two levels, A = 0 and A=1 and a continuous outcome Y.  Estimating the causal effect of A on outcome Y requires contrasting two states of the world.  Y when, perhaps contrary to fact, A is set to 1, or Y|A=1, which we write as {a=1},Y and secondly Y when, perhaps contrary to fact, A is set to 0, or Y|A =1 which we may write asY^{a=0}. We say that A affects Y  when the quantitiesY^{a=1} - Y^{a=0} \\neq 0.   Note that, at any given time, at most only one level of the exposure A may be realised for any individual. That is, Y^{a=1} and Y^{a=0} are never simultaneously observed in any individual.  As such, individual-level causal effects are not typically identifiable from data. It is for this reason that we refer to the Y^{a=1} and Y^{a=0} as “potential” or “counterfactual” outcomes. However, when certain conditions are satisfied we may identify the average or marginal causal effects at the level of groups of individuals who are experience different levels of exposure.  We say there is an average or marginal causal effect if the difference of the averages of the population who are exposed and unexposed does not equal zero:  E(Y^{a=1}) - E(Y^{a=0})\\neq 0 , or because the difference of the means is equivalent to the mean of the differences, if E(Y^{a=1} - Y^{a=0})\\neq 0.  This contrast in tje expected average of the counterfactual outcomes is the marginal effect. Here, our example uses a binary exposure but we may contrast the counterfactual outcomes for two levels of a continuous exposure. To do this we must state the levels of exposure at which we seek comparisons. \nCrtitically, to ensure valid inference, we need to ensure that the potential outcomes are independent of the exposures received, namely: \nY^a  \\perp\\!\\!\\!\\perp A|L\nOr equivalently:\nA \\perp\\!\\!\\!\\perp Y^a |L\nIf we have have only observational data, we cannot generally ensure that the exposures are independent of the counterfactual outcomes. For this reason, we use sensitivity analyis such at the calculating an E-value to assess the robustness of any result to unmeasured confounding (VanderWeele and Ding 2017)."

    "text": "The steps for G-computation\n\nFirst we fit a regression for each outcome on the exposure A\\_{t0} and baseline covariates\\boldsymbol{L} = (L_1, L_2,L_3 \\dots L_n). To avoid implausible assumptions of linearity we model the relationship between the exposure each of the potential outcomes of interest using a cubic spline.  We include in the set of baseline confounders \\boldsymbol{L} the baseline measure of the exposure as well as the baseline response (or responses): \\{A\\_{t-1}, \\boldsymbol{Y_{t-1}} = (Y_{1, t-1}, Y_{2, t-1}, Y_{3, t-1}\\dots Y_{n, t-1})\\} \\subset \\boldsymbol{L}.  \n\nThis model give us E(Y|A, \\boldsymbol{L})\n\nSecond, we use the model in (1) to predict the values of a potential outcome Y^{a} by setting the exposure to the value A = a.\n\nThis model gives us \\hat{E}(Y|A = a, \\boldsymbol{L})\n\nThird, we use the model in (1) to predict the values of a different potential outcome Y^{a*}by setting the exposure to a different value of A =a^{\\star}.\n\nThis model gives us  \\hat{E}(Y|A = a*,\\boldsymbol{L})\n\nForth we obtain the focal contrast as the expected difference in the expected average outcomes when exposure at levels a* and a. Where outcomes are continuous we calculate both mean of Y^a and the mean of  Y^{a*} and then obtain their difference.  This gives give us: \n\n\\hat{ATE} = \\hat{E}[\\hat{E}(Y|A = a, \\boldsymbol{L}) - \\hat{E}(Y|A = a*, \\boldsymbol{L})]\n\nWhere outcomes are binary, we calculate the causal risk ratio in moving between the different levels of A. Where binary outcomes are more common than 10% we use a log-normal model to calculate a causal rate ratio (VanderWeele, Mathur, and Chen 2020). \nThe stdReg package in R calculates standard errors using the Delta method from which we construct confidence intervals under asymptotic assumptions(Sjölander 2016). Additionally, we pool uncertainty arising from the multiple imputation procedure by employing Rubin’s Rules."

    "text": "Importance\nThere are three audiences who might be interested in the longitudinal study of anti-religious prejudice.\nFirst, there are social scientists. There has been considerable scientific attention to study of prejudice against historically marginalised groups. However, in countries such as New Zealand, religious people have only recently become the minority. Moreover, the bulk of prejudice research occurs in North America where the religiously identified remain a majority.\nSecond, there are philosophers and theologians. If we assume that good philosophy and theology must be grounded in the facts, it would seem important to include a growing religious minority in philosophical and theological reflection about prejudice.\nThird, there are members of religious communities, including clergy. If the study of anti-religious prejudice reveals that many religious people are indeed experiencing greater prejudice religious communities should want to know."

    "text": "Conclusion\nThe topic is under-researched. religious decline is slow. Although religious people are a minority in New Zealand, for most of New Zealand’s colonial history there has been a religious majority. Because the decline in religious identification is less than 1% annually, the proportion of religious proportion year-to-year is not substantially different (Hoverd et al. 2015). Like the receding of a glacier, the decline of the religious minority is not readily apparent to the naked eye. Although these facts may help to explain the poverty of research on anti-religious prejudice, they do not provide excuses for ignoring it."
