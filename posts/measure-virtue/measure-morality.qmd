## Introduction

Religion spans the full bandwidth of human diversity. Despite this diversity, nearly all religions agree that greatest goods in life come from virtuous living. Indeed, in classical Christian thought, religion itself is a virtue. Religion consists of acts and prayers that appropriately acknowledge God as the source of our existence and continuance [@aquinas1702].

If the cultivation of virtue, including the virtue of religion, indeed makes life good, then in theory the effects virtuous living should be observable. If such effects are observable, then in theory they should be measurable. If the effects of virtuous living are measurable, then in theory, such effects should be amenable to scientific study.

This article has three objectives.

First, I consider credible objections to the proposition that virtue, including the virtue of religion, can form the object of scientific study.

Second, I consider a pragmatic argument for the scientific study of virtue as interesting despite the credible objections raised against it. Here, I describe an approach that leverages the repeated measurement of individuals in large national cohort studies over the course of their lifespans. This approach belongs to what Tyler VanderWeele calls outcomewide longitudinal flourishing science [@vanderweele2020].

Finally, I consider three audiences for whom the scientific study of virtue might be interesting: (1) human scientists; (2) theologians; (3) teachers and clergy.

Here, I restrict focus to the psychological science of virtue. There are, of course, other sciences that may be relevant, such as economics, sociology, and archaeology. It is an open question whether consideration of challenges and opportunities of a psychological science of virtue generalise to other scientific domains. At any rate, the field about which I am most familiar.

## Objections to measuring virtue

Consider the following credible objections to a psychological science of virtue.

Psychological scientists study how people think and behave. However, in classical philosophical and religious reflection, virtue is conceived of as a skill, and the expression of a virtue is subject both to deficiencies and excesses. For example, Aristotle held that the deficiency of courage is cowardice and the excess of courage is rashness; the deficiency of temperance is indulgence and the excess of temperance is insensibility. Notably, to judge a behavior as virtuous or vicious would appear to require that one possesses the relevant virtue. Here we may draw an analogy to music. To assess the quality of a jazz musician requires competence in the genre. Although we may study jazz from a behavioral or cognitive perspective such a study would not carry us to an appreciation of excellence in the genre. Similarly, it is unclear how the study of human thought and behaviour would carry us to an appreciation of moral excellence. Which thoughts and behaviours should form the topic of the interest? What should one consider when measuring these thoughts and behaviours? What are the marks of virtue? How is such virtue to be distinguished from vice?

A second, related challenge to the psychological science of virtue is practical, namely that virtue pertains to experiences which may be poorly represented in human language. In the **Varieties of Religious Experience**, William James writes, "Philosophy lives in words, but truth and fact well up into our lives in ways that exceed verbal formulation. There is in the living act of perception always something that glimmers and twinkles and will not be caught, and for which reflection comes too late" [@james1902, pp.456-457]. Even if we could recognise virtue when we perceive it, how might we speak of it? Consider again the analogy to jazz music. A complete behavioural and cognitive explanation of jazz could not arguable substitute an understanding and appreciation of the art form. Similarly, all classical traditions conceive of the cultivation and expression of the virtues as a form of art or skill.

A third credible challenge to a psychological science of virtue relates to the appreciation that psychological science investigates average effects. The idealised "random experiment" is the gold standard of psychological design. We use chance to assign individuals to either a treatment or a control condition, and investigate the average response within each condition. If these responses differ, we say that the treatment has a causal effect. However, the inference pertains to the average response. Within each condition may be those who respond better or worse than average, or who do not respond at all [@bulbulia2022; @hernan2023]. Although the average response is the holy grail of psychological science, teachers and learners of virtue will want to know what works for individuals.

## Responses to objections

I describe the preceding arguments against a psychological science of virtue as "credible" because I believe them. The psychological science of virtue should begin with a sober appreciation of what the science can deliver.

First, a psychological science of virtue cannot substitute for the cultivation of virtue.

Second, a psychological science of virtue is limited in the scope of knowledge that it can afford.

Third, psychological science investigates average effects across populations and sub-populations. There is no science of individual-level effect. Teachers and learners of virtues should be weary of generalising to individuals.
